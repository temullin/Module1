An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

Module 1 work, Berkeley
This project utilizes data from the Kickstarter spreadsheet to provide meaningful information to the client.
I can't tell by the directions if we are actually supposed to be doing an analysis or the directions are just saying that is what we will be doing.
I am going to move on to the first challenge.
